                <p>
                    The LinkedIn Post Intelligence System is an AI-powered tool designed to help content creators 
                    understand and predict the engagement potential of their LinkedIn posts. By analyzing post content 
                    using machine learning, the system provides actionable insights to improve content strategy and 
                    maximize audience engagement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This system analyzes various aspects of post content including sentiment, structure, keywords, 
                    and linguistic patterns to predict whether a post will receive High, Medium, or Low engagement 
                    based on historical data patterns.

                <h3>Machine Learning Model</h3>
                <ul class="info-list">
                    <li><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Random Forest Classifier</li>
                    <li><strong>Feature Extraction:</strong> TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)</li>
                    <li><strong>Training Data:</strong> 2,500 LinkedIn posts with engagement metrics</li>

                <h3>Engagement Calculation</h3>
                <p>
                    Engagement scores are calculated using a weighted formula that considers multiple interaction types:
                </p>
                <div class="formula-box">
                    <code>Engagement = Likes + (2 × Comments) + (3 × Shares)</code>
                </div>
                <p class="formula-note">
                    Comments and shares are weighted more heavily as they indicate stronger audience engagement.

                    Our system uses advanced explainability techniques to identify which specific lines or sections 
                    of your post contribute most to the predicted engagement level. This is achieved through:
